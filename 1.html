        <h2>What is the LUX MUNDI cup 2024, and What was your experience during the event?</h2>
<p>The Lux Mundi Cup 2024 (LMC 2024) is a college-wide event similar to high school intramurals.
     It gives students the chance to showcase their talents in various areas, such as sports, 
     dance, singing, academic writing, and more.
      Various institutes within the college compete to become champions while enjoying the event. 
      As a first-year student at Tangub City Global College, 
      LMC 2024 was a fantastic experience and my first opportunity to participate in such a memorable event. 
    I was proud to represent my institute in the discus throw, where I achieved second place.</p>
